    "I did it!" Chip McCallahan beamed as he strutted into the lounge of the Bit Busters Computer Club, grabbed a prepackaged hot coffee and some cookies, and plopped down on the leather, reclinable, multi-adjustable, temperature-controlled, fully digital smart-couch opposite Melinda. "I finally beat your overall high score!"
    </p>

    <p>
    The Bit Busters president and top brain gave him a look over the top of her copy of <em>Qubits</em> magazine. "Let me guess, you took that supposedly impossible walker shortcut in that one level of the third challenge? You know that's cheating."
    </p>

    <p>
    "All's fair in love and scoring," Chip responded brightly, and grinned when she blushed. He had only recently begun to figure out ways to get her to do that. It seemed to help level the playing field between them.
    </p>

    <p>
    "That's as may be," she replied tartly, setting aside her magazine. "But enjoy your laurels while you can. Pretty soon I'll have an opportunity to improve my own score."
    </p>

    <p>
    "Really?" Chip leaned forward, excited. "What kind of opportunity?"
    </p>

    <p>
    Melinda responded with a gleam in her eye. "The board has finally approved the grand opening of the fourth official Clubhouse Challenge!"

    <h2>How to Play</h2>

    <p>The CCLP4 package contains the following files:</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td class="rpad"><tt>data/CCLP4.dat</tt></td>
        <td>The main levelset data file</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="rpad"><tt>data/CCLP4.ccx</tt></td>
        <td>Story and author information file for Tile World 2</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="rpad"><tt>sets/*.dac</tt></td>
        <td>Configuration files for Tile World</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="rpad"><tt>CCLP4.html</tt></td>
        <td>This documentation file</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="rpad"><tt>cclp4res/</tt></td>
        <td>Images and other supporting files for this documentation</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Using Tile World</h3>

    <p>
      To play CCLP4 using <a href="http://www.pillowpc2001.net/TW2/">Tile World 2</a>
      or <a href="http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tworld/">Tile World</a>,
      just copy the <tt>data</tt> and <tt>sets</tt> directories to Tile World's
      standard location for these files. On Windows, this is the directory where
      Tile World has been installed. On Linux, the default location is
      <tt>/usr/local/share/tworld</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Tile World, you have the choice of playing CCLP4 under either the
      original Lynx ruleset (which also features animated gameplay), or under
      the MS ruleset (as in Microsoft Chip's Challenge). Tile World also records
      your solutions automatically and lets you play them back later.
    </p>

    <h3>Using Microsoft Chip's Challenge (MSCC)</h4>

    <p>
      To play CCLP4 using the Microsoft version of Chip's Challenge, all you need is
      the <tt>CCLP4.dat</tt> file from the <tt>data</tt> folder.
      To make MSCC use this file, you will need a program such as
      <a href="http://cctools.translucentdragon.com/">CCTools</a>,
      <a href="http://www.pillowpc2001.net/controls/">Chip's Controls</a> or
      <a href="http://tilde.town/~magical/chip/MyChips.zip">MyChips</a>.

      for designing levels and offering them for inclusion in CCLP4. Due to the
      number of levels in the set being limited, some designers could not have
      their creations included in CCLP4, but they certainly offered some stiff
      competition to the ones that did. The detailed list of levels and authors
